# Your Daily Planner:
The intention of this application is to generate a multiple choice quiz using vanilla JavaScript. The questions & answers are based on Ben & Jerry's ice cream. If you click on the wrong answer, you will remain on that question **AND** ten seconds will be deducted from your time! FYI: **The functionality of this quiz is not complete**
